For this project, I was given the task to analyze crowdfunding campaigns from an Excel dataset provided by edX Boot Camps LLC. Crowdfunding is when users utilize social media platforms to raise money for a cause. 

For the first worksheet (see Figure 1), I utilized formulas and formatting to create a percent funded column with cells filled with different colors based on conditions. I also created an average donation column and splitted the column "Category and Sub-Catergory" column into two separate columns. Next, I created a new sheet (Figure 2) with a pivot table analyzing the number of successful, live, failed and canceled campaigns by category.
